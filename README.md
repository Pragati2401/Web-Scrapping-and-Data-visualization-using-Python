# Web-Scrapping-and-Data-visualization-using-Python
The project explores web scraping and data visualization using Python on Flipkart to analyze laptop prices, ratings, and specs, aiming for the best deals using tools like pandas and seaborn for data cleaning and visualization.

1. Web Scraping with Python: Utilized Pythonâ€™s BeautifulSoup and requests libraries to scrape laptop prices, ratings, and specifications from Flipkart, ensuring efficient and accurate data collection in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

2. Data Cleaning with Pandas: Processed the scraped data using Pandas, performing tasks like handling missing values and normalizing formats to prepare for detailed analysis. This preparation was crucial for ensuring data quality and reliability.

3. Visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib: Created insightful visualizations in Jupyter Notebook using Seaborn and Matplotlib to illustrate trends in laptop prices and ratings. These visualizations helped identify correlations between product features and prices, highlighting the best purchasing options.

4. Machine Learning Predictions: Developed predictive models using scikit-learn to forecast laptop prices based on their specifications. Evaluated model performance using metrics like MSE and R-squared, providing actionable insights into market trends.
